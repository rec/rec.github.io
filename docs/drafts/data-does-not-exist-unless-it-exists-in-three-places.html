</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <h2>Avoid&nbsp;screaming!</h2>
<p>Few things are more miserable than losing&nbsp;work.</p>
<p>The internet is full of sad, sad stories of people who have lost hours,
days, weeks or more of their lives, often through no fault of their&nbsp;own.</p>
<p>Many years ago I heard an <span class="caps">MP3</span> of an answering machine message from some poor sap
who explained, in increasing agitated terms, that the only copy of a book he had
worked on for years was on a disk that a shop had formatted. Fairly quickly he
was reduced to screaming and&nbsp;weeping.</p>
<p>No one wants to be that person.  So listen to my&nbsp;words:</p>
<h1>Data does not exist unless it exists in three&nbsp;places!</h1>
<p>I&#8217;ve been giving this advice for decades, except I used to say, &#8220;Data does not
exist unless it exists in <em>two</em> places,&#8221; but I learned better through other people&#8217;s&nbsp;experience.</p>
<h2>A few nightmares amongst&nbsp;many</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A power surge during backup destroys your drive and your backup at the same&nbsp;time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your accounts at [BigDataCompany] are frozen due to a mistake that is not yours.
You have no recourse.  Your email address is no longer accessible, and your
offsite backups are attached to your email&nbsp;address.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A water leak or file destroys your computer and the&nbsp;backup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A thief steals your computer and your&nbsp;backup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You erase an important file, and don&#8217;t notice, and it gets erased from your
online backups, but a year later you desperately need&nbsp;it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to count to&nbsp;three</h2>
<h3>Physical backup:&nbsp;onsite</h3>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Onsite&#8221; means &#8220;physically stored with the computer that is being backed&nbsp;up&#8221;.</p>
<p>You get a program that runs continuously, copying your main disk to a backup.
MacOS has its Time Machine, Windows has its Backup and Restore, or there are
many others, sorry I can&#8217;t investigate all the&nbsp;possibilities.</p>
<p>Disks are very cheap, particularly old slow ones.  If you can, get two and rotate:
have two of backup disks, and switch between them every couple of&nbsp;days.</p>
<h3>Physical backup:&nbsp;offsite</h3>
<p>Get a backup buddy, a physical person you know who has your backup!
Every once in a while, exchange a current backup of your system with your
backup&nbsp;buddy.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t trust your buddy, you can encrypt the&nbsp;backups.</p>
<h3>Internet backup:&nbsp;cloud</h3>
<p>The big data providers give some free space for cloud backup and then will
give you more if you&nbsp;ask.</p>
<p>There are also up-and-coming backup services who charge less, but more
important, actually seem to answer questions. If there&#8217;s an actual human, you
might have a chance of proving who you are if, for example, you lose your
ememail address (see&nbsp;above).</p>
<p>This is why I switched from the big data to a smaller backup centered service
with good reviews. But who knows if someone who is good today will be good next
year or ten years from&nbsp;now?</p>
<h3>Internet backup:&nbsp;git</h3>
<p>Every bit of programming I do gets instantly committed, and then pushed to an
offsite repo, as do my configuration files (dotfiles) for my&nbsp;machine.</p>
<p>If I woke up in Australia with an empty new computer, I could continue from
where I left off in a small number of&nbsp;minutes.</p>
<h2>Remember your work is much more important than your&nbsp;system</h2>
<p>It is very useful to have a backup of your whole system software ready to go if
your drive&nbsp;dies.</p>
<p>However, in the worst case you can find another computer, but your work cannot
be&nbsp;replaced.</p>
<p>Prioritize saving your work&nbsp;first.</p>
<p>If you are a writer, a programmer, or even sometimes a musician, It is often the
case that your disk is huge but your current work will fit on a cheap and tiny
thumb&nbsp;drive.</p>
<p>Take advantage of this to copy it to a thumb drive and mail it to someone you
trust, or encrypt it and mail it to someone you trust at least not to reformat
the drive, or (with someone&#8217;s permission), copy a compressed version of your work
onto their machine when you are&nbsp;there.</p>
<p>Conversely, if your friend is over and you know they are a technological
incompetent, offer to back up their system in your backup&nbsp;system.</p>
<p>I have copied a lot of people&#8217;s work that way, and I rescued thousands of one
person&#8217;s photos over decades that would otherwise have been permanently&nbsp;lost.</p>
<p>This alone was worth all the&nbsp;fuss.</p>
